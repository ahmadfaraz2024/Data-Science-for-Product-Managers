This notebook involves analyzing real consumer financial complaints using NLP techniques, including exploratory data analysis, text data cleaning, sentiment prediction, and leveraging large language models like GPT-3.5 to generate summaries and recommendations. The goal is to gain insights from the CFPB consumer complaints dataset.


The dataset contains consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) through its website. Each complaint includes fields like the date received, product and issue categorization (e.g. credit reporting, incorrect information), consumer complaint narrative, company public response, company name, state, tags (e.g. servicemember, Older American), and details on how the complaint was handled like timely response and if the consumer disputed. The unstructured text in the complaint narrative provides insights into the specific issues consumers experience with financial products and services. The metadata fields capture important contextual information like the company, location, and resolution steps. Overall, the rich dataset enables analysis of complaint trends across the financial sector to identify pain points and areas for improvement in customer service.
